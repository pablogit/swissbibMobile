[swissbibMobile](http://sisbsrv15.epfl.ch/library/swissbib) - Mobile Client for Swissbib
========================================================================================

Description
-----------

Based on the [SRU/SRW service from Swissbib](http://www.swissbib.org/wiki/index.php?title=SRU) and the framework [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), swissbibMobile lets you display [swissbib](http://swissbib.ch) search results on all popular mobile device platforms. It happens on the web (HTML5-based), there is no need to install any kind of application. It is written in PHP.

This project was developed as a collaboration between the Swissbib team and [EPFL Library](http://library.epfl.ch). Have a look at [EPFL Library Mobile](http://library.epfl.ch/mobile) to see it live.

If you have an SRU/SRW service available and want to make this accessible for mobile devices, you can use this project as well.
